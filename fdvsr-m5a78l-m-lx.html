My OS is Windows So I recently bought / built a computer from scratch, it'd been a LOOOONG time since I'd built a computer, at least 7-10 years. I'm a bit behind on most of the newer equipment, but put together a decent system for what I do. It's mostly an office computer, with a tiny bit of video editing and watching HD content. Up until recently my store-bought HP has done me well, but something inside kicked the bucket, and I haven't had the time or energy to figure out what it is. I bought Hello, I am selling the CPU/board from a rig I made for my nephew back in January. I lost the I/O shield when I upgraded the rig but am including the stock cooler and some coolmaster paste (came with Hyper Evo 212), Sorry no trades. The price includes shipping. Proof: http://imgur.com/a/zEWPd. For sale: Update 7/10/18: All parts except for the GPU are still available for purchase. # I have some parts from a computer I made back in January 2014, it was the first build I ever made myself. I'm looking for around 180 dollars for these parts listed below. Each part is in perfect working order, but ever since I got a new build in 2016, I haven't been using this system so it has gotten dusty over time. # POWER SUPPLY AND HARD DRIVE NOT INCLUDED. GPU: MSI Radeon R7 260X OC Edition So i talked with the person in the store that build my PC and he pretty much told me that i can run a GTX 950/960 if i want but just in case i decided to ask in here. The model of my Motherboard is M5A78L-M LX Asus Hybrid. Time stamp / pics: Recently upgraded, so I don't need this anymore. Comes with original box and ships in an anti static bag. 30$ shipped.
